TODO WEEK 4:

1. Try adding random noise as an independent feature to LSTM
2. Implement train val test lines function
3. Add random state and Try hyperparameter tuning
4. Try different prediction lengths
5. Try different granularity
6. Try differnet Informer and Autoformer
7. Try differetn patch sizes
8. Find different datasets of multiple households

9. LSTM with all feature with refeeding
10. LSTM with Higher window size
<!-- 3. Transfomer with no refeeding -->
11. Transformer with refeeding
12. Transformer with refeeding with all feature
13. Transformer with refeeding with higher window
14. Compute differences between the MSE for 1 step ahead, 2 step, 3 step ahead

15. Organize the functions

- Differences between MSE for refeeding and no refeeding
